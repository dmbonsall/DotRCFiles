These are my .rc files for bash and various other applications. 

Best way to install this repo is with the following command:

git clone --bare https://github.com/dmbonsall/DotRCFiles.git $HOME/.rc.d

This will copy these files into your home directory. Beware that they may
overwrite your existing configuration files so I would recomend backing them
up prior to cloning this repo.

Nicola Paolucci wrote a good guide for adding version controls to config files
which I based this off of.
